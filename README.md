Even though that other IDEs like Eclipse have their own preview environment, beginners who are not fond in such things start with XAMPP most likely. There are many other ways to fix it in almost any language or directly in host files on Windows.<br>

But this is an example for a solution in plain JavaScript: <br>

**alocal** ('a' for auto) is a tiny JavaScript snippet which automatically changes your file to localhost - ready for server-side scripts. An alternativity for newbies who plan to start programming in PHP using XAMPP.

### Install
1. Place this script in your root directory of your host.
2. Open to edit a PHP file which must be inside of the root path.
3. Embed **alocal.js** in your page header just like any other linked script<br>
    <code>
      &lt;script src="&lt;path>/alocalv1.js>&lt;/script>
    </code>
4. Save it and it's done.

### Usage
Once embedded, it's ready to perform. Open a PHP file in a browser and see what happens. Nothing really special, just a timesaver.<br>
You may change the path to your root inside the script which you usually use, for example **C://XAMPP/htdocs**.<br>
<br>

Enjoy.<br>
