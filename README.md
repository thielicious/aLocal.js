## INTRODUCTION

**aLocal** ('a' for auto) is a tiny JavaScript snippet which automatically updates the address bar to localhost - ready for server-side scripts.

<br>

## SETUP

1. Follow this [link](http:thielicious.github.io/#alocal_dls) and choose your download option or open your Git CLI and enter the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/thielicious/eMM.git
```
2. Place this script in your root directory of your host.
3. Open any PHP file which must be inside of the root path.
4. Embed **alocal.js** in your page header just like any other linked script<br>
`<script src="http://localhost/aLocal.js"></script>`
5. Save it and done.

<br>

## CONFIGURATION
- **.setPath(path)** defines the root path, default: XAMPP folder
- **.setLocal(server)** defines your server, default: localhost
- **.change()**	executes the change

<br>

## USAGE

Once embedded, it's ready to perform. Simply, open a PHP file in your browser, no need to alter the annoying address bar anymore. Not a special thing but a timesaver.
