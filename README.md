Every time you have to change manually your domain to localhost in the adress bar. Is there any better and faster way? 
Solution: **alocal** ('a' for auto) is a tiny Javascript snippet which automatically replaces your filepath with localhost in the adress bar of your browser. An alternativity for newbies who plan to start programming in PHP or ASP without using a RE in an IDE.

### Install
1. Place this script in your root folder of your workplace like eg. in **XAMPP/htdocs/**
2. Embed the file in your page header<br>
    <code>
      &lt;script src="&lt;path>/swIMGv091.js>&lt;/script>
    </code>

### Usage
Once embedded, it's ready to perform. Open a PHP file from a file directory in a browser and see what happens.

This script simply performs itself automatically on page-load. You may change your path inside the script which you usually use for example **XAMPP/htdocs**, to whatever your location is.
