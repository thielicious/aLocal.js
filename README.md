Abart from IDEs, every time you have to change manually your domain to localhost in the adress bar. Is there any better and faster way? <br>
Solution: **alocal** ('a' for auto) is a tiny Javascript snippet which automatically changes your file to localhost - ready for server-side scripts. An alternativity for newbies who plan to start programming in PHP or ASP without using a RE in an IDE.

### Install
1. Place this script in your root directory of your host.
2. Open to edit a PHP file which must be inside of the root path.
3. Embed **alocal.js** in your page header<br>
    <code>
      &lt;script src="&lt;path>/alocalv1.js>&lt;/script>
    </code>
4. Save it and it's done.

### Usage
Once embedded, it's ready to perform. Open a PHP file in a browser and see what happens. Nothing really special, just a timesaver.

This script simply performs itself automatically on page-load. You may change the path to your root inside the script which you usually use, for example **C://XAMPP/htdocs**.<br>

Enjoy.<br>
